=========================================


Fetch model description from models.

Delft3D, developed by Deltares (formerly Delft Hydraulics), is a flexible integrated modelling suite, which simulates two-dimensional (in either the horizontal or a vertical plane) and three-dimensional flow, sediment transport and morphology, waves, water quality and ecology and is capable of handling the interactions between these processes. After Delft3D-FLOW was open-sourced in 2011, more and more researchers started using Delft3D.
