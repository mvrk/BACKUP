    Before you are able to create a new model input or a new job, you will have to create a project.
    Project serves as a container for the relevant model inputs and jobs. You can create model inputs
    for different models within the same project. A short summary of a prject shall be added to
    project description, which will serve as the overall summary in the project report.
